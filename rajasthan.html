    <p ><font color="black" face="blackadder ITC" size="03">Tourism leads to enviornmental pollution. Greenhouse gas emission from air travel and littering at popular locations are the major problems.Due to the increasement in population, resources become unsustainable and get exhausted. At hotspot tourist places, crime rates are very high, usage of alcohol and illegal drugs also increase. It also forces local residents to leave their home and displace because of very high noise and crowdedness.Road accidents is another negative outcome of tourism development since visitors are not aware of local rules, driving norms, and road conditions. </p>

    <p ><font color="black" face="blackadder ITC" size="03">Most of the monumental places have a religious tourism. For example the hawa mahal is said to be in the shape of the crown of lord krishna.It is very beautiful to look at and if we talk about Amber palace it was the residence of the Rajput Maharajas and their families.Religious people would always go to see these monuments which are located in jaipur.If we make more religious places dedicated to the gods there would be more tourists around that place.we could also provide some more security at the already existing monuments.We could tell the people to always maintain social distancing because of COVID-19 right now. </p>
